# midwestern-interactive-tech-challenge

# This is a technical challenge given by Midwestern Interactive. The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate technical abliity using a variety of technology stacks. The tech stacks that I will be using to complete these tasks will be the following:

## Frontend

---

- React
- Next.js
- Javascript
- JSX
- CSS

## Backend

---

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Nodemon

## To run the project git clone the repository and `cd` into either the `frontend` or `backend` and run `npm install`

---

# Afterword

- Throughout this challenge I was dealing with errors with the new version of Next.js. I would sometimes have to downgrade and then upgrade the versions. I wasn't exactly sure how to remove duplicates in arrays, and so I found an article that explained it. I forgot how to display the text for the array's after a button click, so I asked someone on Discord for help. I managed to implement the backend for being able to make a `GET` and `POST` request to the best of my ability. I was able to make `GET` requests fine, but for some reason `POST` wasn't extracting all the keys and values I inserted. It may have been something on my machine, because at the moment I'm having errors with MongoDB.
  Either way I very much enjoyed doing this technical challenge.
